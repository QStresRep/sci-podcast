Welcome to today’s episode. We’re diving into a fascinating new study published in Nature Aging. The paper is titled “Comprehensive evaluation of plasma tau biomarkers for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer’s disease in a multicenter and multiethnic aging population.” It appears in Nature Aging, Volume 5, August 2025, and was published online on June 23, 2025. The work is a collaborative effort with multiple contributors, led by first author [insert first-listed name here], and guided by corresponding authors Kaj Blennow from the University of Gothenburg, Fang Xie from Fudan University, and Tengfei Guo from Shenzhen Bay Laboratory. This study takes a deep look at plasma tau biomarkers and their role in diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer’s disease across diverse populations. With me today is one of the lead scientists from the study. Thank you for joining us. To start off—why is this research important right now?
Scientist:
Thank you for having me. Alzheimer’s disease is a major global health challenge, with more than 55 million people affected by dementia worldwide, and China alone accounting for about a quarter of all cases. Many patients in Asia, especially China, remain untreated due to low awareness and high costs of diagnostic tests like PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. As new disease-modifying drugs become available, we need accurate, affordable, and scalable biomarkers to identify who will benefit most. That’s where blood-based tau biomarkers come in. They offer a simple, noninvasive way to detect the disease much earlier and at lower cost.
Host:
So, let’s unpack the background a bit more. What was the main research question you wanted to address?
Scientist:
Previous studies suggested phosphorylated tau proteins in blood—like p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231—could be strong biomarkers for Alzheimer’s. But most of that evidence came from Western populations. We didn’t know how well these markers perform in Asian cohorts, especially given biological and clinical differences. Our central question was: Which tau biomarkers, measured in plasma, best capture Alzheimer’s pathology and disease progression in a large, multiethnic, multicenter setting?
Host:
That brings us to your study design. Can you briefly describe the cohorts, the participants, and the technical approaches you used?
Scientist:
Of course. We studied 1,085 participants from three independent cohorts. Two were in China—the Greater Bay Area Healthy Aging Brain Study (GHABS, n=425, mostly cognitively unimpaired) and the Huashan memory clinic cohort in Shanghai (n=297, mostly cognitively impaired). The third was the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort from North America (n=363).
We measured several tau species in plasma: p-tau217, p-tau181, p-tau231, brain-derived tau (BD-tau), and NT1-tau. For p-tau217, we tested four different commercial assays. Then, we compared these plasma measures against gold-standard outcomes: amyloid-PET, tau-PET, MRI for brain atrophy, FDG-PET for metabolism, and cognitive assessments like MoCA and MMSE. This gave us both cross-sectional and longitudinal insights.
Host:
That’s a robust design. What were your headline findings—what stood out most?
Scientist:
The clear winner was plasma p-tau217. It rose earlier than other tau markers in response to subtle amyloid plaques, showed the strongest correlations with tau tangles, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive decline, and outperformed all other plasma biomarkers in distinguishing PET-positive from PET-negative individuals.
Importantly, we found that even participants with intermediate levels of plasma p-tau217—not yet fully abnormal—were already accumulating amyloid and tau faster, and were declining more quickly cognitively. That intermediate group could be a key target for early intervention.
Host:
You mentioned “intermediate levels.” Could you explain the two-cutoff approach you used and why it matters?
Scientist:
Yes. Typically, biomarker tests have a single cutoff point—normal versus abnormal. We used two cutoffs, creating three categories: negative, intermediate, and positive. This added nuance.
With this approach, plasma p-tau217 classified Alzheimer’s pathology with accuracies around 90% across cohorts. And the intermediate group turned out to be clinically meaningful: they weren’t clearly positive, but they still showed faster amyloid and tau accumulation, hypometabolism, and greater risk of cognitive conversion. So, instead of labeling them “uncertain,” we can flag them for closer monitoring or early trial recruitment.
Host:
Fascinating. Let’s get into the comparative side. How did p-tau217 perform against other biomarkers like p-tau181, BD-tau, or NT1-tau?
Scientist:
Plasma p-tau181 also tracked Alzheimer’s changes but consistently lagged behind p-tau217. p-tau231 showed weaker and less consistent results, often more tied to amyloid than tau pathology. BD-tau and NT1-tau became abnormal much later in the disease and seemed to reflect downstream neurodegeneration rather than early pathology. In head-to-head comparisons, p-tau217 was superior at every stage—early amyloid detection, tau tangles, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline.
Host:
And how about across populations? Did you notice differences between the Chinese cohorts and the North American ADNI group?
Scientist:
That was a key reason for our study. Overall, p-tau217 was robust across all populations, but we did see subtle differences. For example, in the community-based GHABS cohort, plasma markers detected tau pathology especially well in amyloid-positive individuals. In the clinic-based Huashan cohort, with more impaired patients, performance patterns shifted slightly, likely due to higher baseline pathology. These nuances highlight the importance of validating biomarkers in the target population, rather than assuming results from Western cohorts apply everywhere.
Host:
Let’s turn to implications. How do your findings influence clinical practice or future trials?
Scientist:
Our data strongly support plasma p-tau217 as the leading blood biomarker for Alzheimer’s. Clinically, it could be used as a first-line screening tool, reducing reliance on costly PET or invasive CSF tests. It also helps identify those most likely to benefit from anti-amyloid therapies—patients with amyloid pathology but not too much tau.
For research, especially in Asia, it provides a scalable tool for large population screening, early diagnosis, and clinical trial recruitment. It may even guide personalized treatment, by monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response.
Host:
That’s a big leap forward. Were there any surprises or challenges you encountered in the study?
Scientist:
One surprise was just how consistent p-tau217 was across different assays and populations. Another was the intermediate group, which we didn’t expect to show such meaningful pathology. A challenge was harmonizing assays—different commercial tests for the same biomarker can perform differently. That’s why international standardization efforts are critical for future clinical use.
Host:
Finally, looking ahead, what are the next steps for this research area?
Scientist:
Several directions. First, validating plasma p-tau217 in even more diverse populations, including rural or resource-limited settings. Second, integrating plasma tau with other blood biomarkers, like plasma Aβ or neurofilament light, to create multiparameter panels. Third, using these tools not just for diagnosis but for longitudinal monitoring in trials of new drugs. Ultimately, we aim for a world where a simple blood test can reliably detect, monitor, and help guide treatment for Alzheimer’s disease across different populations.
Host:
That’s an inspiring vision. Thank you so much for walking us through this work.
